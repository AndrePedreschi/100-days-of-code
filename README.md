# 100-days-of-code

The idea of the project is to commit yourself at least one hour a day to code in any language you want for a hundred days (at least). The regularity is key here, you need to practice a bit everyday, including the weekends.
All the challenges presented here goes from easy to hard levels. Most of the challenges can be solved in three hours or less.

### Rules

- The main rule: Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.

* Choose a language you wan't to learn or improve
* Share your progress daily in your social medias
* Don't copy code from the internet
* Try to come up with a solution, even if it's not the best
* Try to always write tests for your code
