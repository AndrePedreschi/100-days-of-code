# Broken Keyboard

Help! My keyboard is broken, only a few keys work any more. If I tell you what keys work, can you tell me what words I can write?

(You should use the trusty **dictionary1.txt** file, located at _assets_ folder).

## Input

A string of letters representing the keys that work on the keyboard, example:

```text
abcd
```
```text
qwer
```
```text
hjklo
```

## Output

Your program should emit the longest valid English language word you can make for each keyboard configuration.


## Example

```text
longestWord("abcd") ➞ bacaba
longestWord("qwer") ➞ ewerer
longestWord("hjklo") ➞ kolokolo
```

## Challenge Output
```text
edcf ➞ deedeed
bnik ➞  bikini
poil ➞ pililloo
vybu ➞ bubby
```
